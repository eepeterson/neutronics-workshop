# Making CAD geometry

Please allow 10 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/11).

In this task you will use CadQuery and Paramak to create CAD geometry which can be converted into a neutronics-ready model.

**Learning Outcomes**

- CAD geometry can be used to build complex models with splines for use in neutronics simulations.
- CAD-based neutronics has a number of advantages over CSG-based neutronics such as implicit voids.
