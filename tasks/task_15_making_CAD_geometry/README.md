# Task Introduction

Please allow 10 minutes for this task.

In this task you will use CadQuery and Paramak to create CAD geometry which can be converted into a neutronics-ready model.

**Learning Outcomes**

- CAD geometry can be used to build complex models with splines for use in neutronics simulations.
- CAD-based neutronics has a number of advantages over CSG-based neutronics such as implicit voids.
