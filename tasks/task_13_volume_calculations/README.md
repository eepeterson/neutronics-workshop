# Task Introduction

In this task you will use OpenMC to calculate the volumes of cells in the geometry.

Volumes of cells are needed for some types of simulation (e.g. depletion)

**Learning Outcomes**

- The volume of a cell or a material can be found using the stochastic volume method.
- Volume found using stochastic has an accompanied by a uncertainty.
- Volumes of cells in DAGMC geometry can be calculated using pydagmc.
