# Task Introduction

This task demonstrates how to convert CAD to DAGMC neutronics geometry.

The methods demonstrated include converting a CAD file in STEP format and converting a CadQuery object in memory.

There are aspects to consider such as mesh sizing, type of mesh desired (surface or volume) and more advanced topics such as implicit complement material.
