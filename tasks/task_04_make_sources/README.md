# Task Introduction

Please allow 20 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop/#/5).

In this task you will use OpenMC to create and visualize neutron point sources with different energy distributions. You will use the parametric_plasma_source package to create and visualize a more realistic plasma source. You will use OpenMC to track particles through a geometry during a simulation. Finally, you will use OpenMC to create a gamma source.

**Learning Outcomes**

- OpenMC can be used to create neutron and gamma sources with different energy distributions for use in neutronics simulations.
- The parametric_plasma_source package provides an easy way to create a complex plasma source.
- Particle tracks through a geometry can be tracked during a neutronics simulation.
