    "This script simulates D1S method of shut down dose rate on a simple CSG model with one aluminum sphere and one iron sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds the additional complexity of mixed neutron source terms. In this case we simulate two pulses of neutrons from DD fusion reactions which have energy of 2.5MeV and then a pulse of neutrons from a DT fusion reaction which have neutrons of 14MeV.\n",
    "\n",
    "This need to simulate the activation after different neutron source terms is a common need in fusion power plants which typically plan to start operations without using tritium and gradually work up to full DT operation.\n",
