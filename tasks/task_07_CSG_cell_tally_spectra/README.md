# Task Introduction

Please allow 15 minutes for this task.

In this task you will use OpenMC to tally neutron and photon spectra on different surfaces and cells in a geometry.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Plotting neutron / photon spectra for cells and surfaces and observing the changing neutron energy at different locations in the reactor.
- Performing coupled neutron photon simulations where photons are created from neutron interactions.
