# Fusion Energy Neutronics Workshop

The book contains a set of example neutronics analysis needed for fusion reactor design.

The goal is to provided minimal examples for all the main types of neutronics analysis that are carried out for fusion reactor design and analysis.

Contributions and feedback are welcome on the [repository home page](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop/).

There is an accompanying [slide](https://fusion-energy.github.io/neutronics-workshop-slides/index.html) deck that introduces the workshop and each task.

There is also a [Gather Town](https://gather.town/app/QnHxhg6bPf8KQdii/openmc-workshop) space which is great for working through the workshop with colleagues.
