# Fusion Energy Neutronics Workshop
A selection of resources for learning fusion neutronics simulations with a
particular focus on [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/), [DAGMC](https://svalinn.github.io/DAGMC/)
and [Paramak](https://paramak.readthedocs.io)

There is a [slide](https://fusion-energy.github.io/neutronics-workshop-slides/index.html) deck that introduces the workshop and each task.

There is also a [Gather Town](https://gather.town/app/QnHxhg6bPf8KQdii/openmc-workshop) space which is great for working through the workshop with colleagues.

The repository has benefited greatly from user feedback. Please feel free to
raise GitHub [issues](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop/issues)
or reach out in the [discussions](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop/discussions)
section if you spot anything that needs fixing or think of an improvement.
Pull requests are very welcome.

The video below gives a brief explainer of what to expect in the workshop and some motivation for learning neutronics.
