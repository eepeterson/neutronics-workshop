# Install optional extras

This is not required for the half day workshop but some of the more advanced tasks do benefit from having Paraview and or FreeCAD installed.

1. Some tasks require the use of Paraview to view the 3D meshes produced.
Parview can be downloaded from [here](https://www.paraview.org/download/).
