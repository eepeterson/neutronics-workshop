# Fusion Energy Neutronics Workshop
A selection of resources for learning fusion neutronics simulations with a
particular focus on [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/), [DAGMC](https://svalinn.github.io/DAGMC/)
and [Paramak](https://paramak.readthedocs.io)

There is a [slide](https://fusion-energy.github.io/neutronics-workshop-slides/index.html) deck that introduces the workshop and each task.

There is also a [Gather Town](https://gather.town/app/QnHxhg6bPf8KQdii/openmc-workshop) space which is great for working through the workshop with colleagues.

There are several ways to use this resource with local installation (pip, Conda, Mamba) options cloud based options (Binder, Codespaces) both of which let you run the modify and run the notebook example simulations.

The repository has benefited greatly from user feedback. Please feel free to
raise GitHub [issues](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop/issues)
or reach out in the [discussions](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop/discussions)
section if you spot anything that needs fixing or think of an improvement.
Pull requests are very welcome.

Please note I am currently converting Python scripts and making notebooks compatible with this new Juypter book layout. I've not ported everything across yet. There are currently more tasks in the [tasks folder of the repo](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop/tree/main/tasks) then on this Jupyer book.

The video below gives a brief explainer of what to expect in the workshop and some motivation for learning neutronics.
